## Terraform State
One advantage, Terraform has over other configuration management tools like Ansible and Chef is State management. Terraform stores/tracks all our infrastructure information(that we have created using Terraform) in a file with the name `terraform.tfstate`. 

In the last chapter, we have ran `terraform apply`. This command would create the above mentioned JSON flavoured statefile. Let us look at its the content.

`terraform.tfstate`

### Usecase 1
This file contains the metadata of our ec2 instance that we have created in the last chapter. This information will be critical when we have to create `other resources which references this` ec2 instance. As we add more resources to the terrform template, this file will get populated with more metadata about each resource.

### Usecase 2
What happens when someone manually changes(which is not desirable) the properties of the instance created by Terraform? We can undo the manual changes just by running `terraform apply` again. One point to keep in mind though is, some property changes forces resource recreation which might result in data loss.

### Changes in Terrfaform state

Let us see what happens to tfstate file when we destroy the ec2 instance
```
terraform destroy
```

```
[output]
aws_instance.webserver: Refreshing state... (ID: i-02489cdf638f05bbd)

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  - destroy

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  - aws_instance.webserver


Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.

Do you really want to destroy?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

  Enter a value: yes
  [...]
aws_instance.webserver: Still destroying... (ID: i-02489cdf638f05bbd, 1m0s elapsed)
aws_instance.webserver: Destruction complete after 1m0s

Destroy complete! Resources: 1 destroyed.
```

`file: terraform.tfstate`
```
{
    "version": 3,
    "terraform_version": "0.11.7",
    "serial": 2,
    "lineage": "138bb0c6-ca69-0d39-aa90-5e08f29c8efb",
    "modules": [
        {
            "path": [
                "root"
            ],
            "outputs": {},
            "resources": {},
            "depends_on": []
        }
    ]
}
```

Once the machine is destroyed, all metadata about that machine is also gone.
